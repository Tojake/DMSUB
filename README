This program (or rather code) has been published under the BSD 3-clause license as stated in the file "license". It is part of my bachelor thesis
"Automatic Subgenre Classification of Dance Music" written at RWTH Aachen.

Its purpose is the extraction of features from song files and achieving classification scores.
It has only been tested on Microsoft Windows 10. I am not accountable for wrong results or damage done by the execution of the code.
